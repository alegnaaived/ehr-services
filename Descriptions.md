# Additional descriptions
This section will answer some requirements that will not be implemented but considered for the POC.
## Requirement
Describe and plan out, but donâ€™t implement, an API design that allows for
scalability as more users are added. This could involve efficient data structures,
load balancing, or other techniques.
### Description
For this requirement, I consider to use configure Supabase to handle authentication and database. You can use your Supabase credentials for online users, or create the container, using a custom .env or .env.prod file.

As supabase doesn't have the desired docker hub image, to achieve te Self-Hosting with Docker, we could follow the [supabase guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) and create a deployment in the cloud.

I also considered to use GraphQL, but instead I used PostgreSQL.
